# Neural Network Letter Recognition (A–E) in C#

This project implements a basic character recognition system using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network in C#. The goal is to recognize letters **A, B, C, D, and E** from binary 7x5 matrices using a feedforward neural network with a single hidden layer.

## 🔧 Technologies
- **Language:** C#
- **Framework:** .NET / WinForms
- **Model:** MLP Neural Network (Single hidden layer)

## 🧠 Neural Network Architecture
- **Input layer:** 35 neurons (7x5 matrix flattened)
- **Hidden layer:** [Custom number] of neurons (you can adjust this)
- **Output layer:** 5 neurons (one for each letter: A–E)
- **Activation Function:** Sigmoid (or any used)
- **Training Method:** Backpropagation

## 🖱️ Features
- GUI-based input using a 7x5 clickable grid (black = 1, white = 0)
- Train/test separation
- Adjustable epsilon (error threshold)
- Ability to visualize and test model output from GUI
- Lightweight and intuitive interface

## 📷 Example Form UI
*(You can include a screenshot here if you have one)*

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Open in Visual Studio
3. Build and run the project
4. Train the model, then test it by clicking on the matrix

## 📁 Project Purpose
Developed for educational purposes to demonstrate basic character recognition using neural networks in C#. Designed to be simple, modifiable, and focused on fundamentals.
